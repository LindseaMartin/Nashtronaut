<p>I am a dog loving, code writing, game playing, car driving hooligan.</p>
<p>My current goals are to complete an internship for a company that can round my skills out in any possible manner.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things I don't understand or know about computer science... but zero things I am not willing to try and learn.</p>

<p>I started learning python3 on my own back at a dead end job. I wanted a better future. I decided to apply for college after I discovered my love for code. Here are a few insights about my journey so far.</p>

- I really enjoy backend coding.
- I really enjoy frontend coding.
- There is no code I don't enjoy.
- I prefer linux over windows.
- I want to learn more modern frameworks, but fundementals have been my focus.
- JetBrains IDE's have been my favourite so far.
- The topic of machine learning is very interesting to me.
- I'll even dare to say this publically... I like Javascript.
- I have a 120lb American Akita named Grizzlee. He is my rubber duck, but he does not look like one.
